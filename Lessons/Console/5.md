## Lesson 5

### Adding Validation with Delegates `(Func<T, string?>)`

**Goal:**

Sometimes we need extra validation beyond just type conversion. Let’s introduce validation.

**What You’ll Learn:**

✅ How to pass a validation function to `GetInput<T>`.

- Modify GetInput<T> to Accept a Validation Function

```csharp
public static T GetInput<T>(string prompt, Func<T, string?>? validateFunc = null)
```

The function passed in will take the converted user input and will return an optional string. If the string is `null` then
validation has passed, otherwise it will contain an error message

- Only execute this function if it was provided (not null)
-

**Example**

```csharp
string? ValidateAge(int age) =>
age is >= 18 and <= 120 ? null : "Age must be between 18 and 120.";

int age = GetInput("Enter your age:", ValidateAge);
Console.WriteLine($"Your age: {age}");
```

### Refactor `GetSelection()`

Once you have implemented the validation function, revisit the `GetSelection` method and try to refactor it so it
uses `GetInput<T>` with a validator function.
