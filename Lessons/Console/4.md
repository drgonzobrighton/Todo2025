## Lesson 4

### Introducing Generics (`GetInput<T>`)

**Goal:**

Instead of writing a separate method for each type (`GetInt`, `GetBool`), we’ll create a single generic method that can handle
multiple types.

**What You’ll Learn:**

- ✅ What generics are and why they’re useful.
- ✅ How to convert string input to different types dynamically.
- ✅ How to reuse code by generalizing our methods.

#### Step 1: Create `GetInput<T>` method

Right now, both `GetInt()` and `GetBool()` are hardcoded for integers/booleans. Instead, let’s make a generic method, so it can
work for any type.

```csharp
public static T GetInput<T>(string prompt)
```

**Try This:**

```csharp
int age = GetInput<int>("Enter your age:");
bool wantsNewsletter = GetInput<bool>("Subscribe to the newsletter? (true/false):");

Console.WriteLine($"Age: {age}, Subscribed: {wantsNewsletter}");
```

Once you have implemented this new method we can delete `GetInt()` and `GetBool()`
