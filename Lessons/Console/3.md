## Lesson 3

### Introducing Strongly Typed Input Handling

**Goal:**

Right now, our `GetSelection` method only works with predefined string options. But real-world applications often need to take
different types of user input—numbers, booleans, dates, etc. In this lesson, we’ll start handling different types explicitly,
without using generics yet.

**What You’ll Learn:**

- ✅ How to read and validate integer input.
- ✅ How to handle boolean input (yes/no/true/false).
- ✅ How to loop until valid input is provided.

#### Step 1: Create `GetInt()` method

- Create a method that prompts the user for a number and ensures they enter a valid integer.
- If the user enters something invalid (like `"abc"`), they should see an error and be asked again.

```csharp
public static int GetInt(string prompt){...}
```

**Example:**

```csharp
int age = GetInt("Enter your age:");
Console.WriteLine($"Your age is {age}");
```

#### Step 2: Create `GetBool()` method

- Now, create a method for boolean input (true/false).
- Accept y/n and true/false as valid inputs.
- Normalize y to true and n to false.

```csharp
public static bool GetBool(string prompt){...}
```

**Example:**

```csharp
bool wantsNewsletter = GetBool("Would you like to subscribe to the newsletter? (y/n/true/false)");
Console.WriteLine($"Subscription status: {wantsNewsletter}");
```
