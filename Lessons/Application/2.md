### Lesson 9

### Wiring Up the Create To-Do Menu Option

**Goal:**

Now that the command and handler for creating to-do items are ready, we’ll hook them into the console UI. In this lesson, you'll
replace the placeholder ConsoleHelper.Print with real logic that gathers input, creates the command, and uses the handler to
create a new item.

✅ Tasks

1. Replace the Create Item Menu Action
    - Update the existing menu item for "Create item" so that it no longer just prints text.
    - Instead, call a new method that handles the actual to-do creation.
2. Implement a Method to Create a To-Do Item
    - In your console project, create a method that:
        - Gets user input for all required fields of the `CreateTodoItemCommand`:
            - Title
            - Description?
            - CompleteBy?
        - Constructs a new instance of `CreateTodoItemCommand`.
        - Creates a new instance of `CreateTodoItemCommandHandler`.
        - Calls the `Handle()` method on the handler.
        - Prints the ID of the newly created item.
3. Register the Method with the Menu

- Update the menu to use the new method for the "Create item" option:

```csharp
   menu.AddItem("Create item", CreateTodoItem);
```

✅ Summary

At the end of this lesson, you’ll have a working “Create item” menu option that:

- Collects input from the user,
- Builds the command,
- Runs the handler logic, and
- Outputs the new to-do item’s ID.

You now have a working end-to-end flow from user interaction to business logic. Next, we’ll look at cleaning up the manual object
creation with dependency injection.
