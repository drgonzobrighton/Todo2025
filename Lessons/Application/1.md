## Lesson 7

### Creating Your First Command – CreateTodoItem

**Goal**:

Start building actual to-do functionality by implementing the command to create a new to-do item. You’ll define the model, the
command, and the handler responsible for executing the logic. We’ll still run everything through the console for now.

✅ Tasks

1. Create a New Project
    - Add a new project named `TodoApp.Application` (class library).
    - Add a reference to this project from your `TodoApp.Console` project.
2. Define the Domain Model
    - Create a folder Models in the `TodoApp.Application` project.
    - Add a class `TodoItem` with the following properties:
        - Id (use GUID)
        - Title
        - IsComplete
        - Description?
        - CompleteBy?
3. Define the Command
    - Create a folder named CreateTodoItem inside `TodoApp.Application`.
    - Add a class `CreateTodoItemCommand` with:
        - Title
        - Description?
        - CompleteBy?
4. Create the Command Handler
    - In the same folder, add a class `CreateTodoItemCommandHandler`.
    - Add a method `Handle` that takes `CreateTodoItemCommand` as an argument and returns a Guid (the item's id)
    - Add logic to:
        - Validate the input (e.g., required title or if description is not null then it should not be an empty string).
            - For now, throw an exception if there is a validation error expalining what went wrong. We will later refactor this
              to
              use the `Result` pattern.
        - Create a new TodoItem.
        - Return the created item’s Id.

5. Test via Console App
    - In `Program.cs`, manually:
        - Collect the required inputs using your InputHandling.
        - Create the command.
        - Call the handler.
        - Print the resulting Id.

✅ Summary

At the end of this lesson, you’ll have created your first real to-do feature, separated into a model, command, and
handler—laying the foundation for the rest of the application.
