### Lesson 9

#### Persisting To-Do Items In-Memory

**Goal:**

So far, every time you create a to-do item, it disappears right after. In this lesson, you'll start persisting to-do items using a
simple in-memory store. This will allow you to retrieve and list them later during the same run of the app.

✅ Concept: Interfaces

Before you start persisting, let’s introduce a new concept: interfaces.

An interface defines a contract for a class — a list of methods the class must implement. It does not contain the implementation
itself.

This helps us:

- Separate what code does from how it does it
- Write flexible and testable code
- Swap implementations later (e.g., replace the in-memory store with a database)

✅ Tasks

1. Define the Repository Interface
    - In the `Todo.Application` project, create a new folder called `Persistence`.
    - Inside that folder, create a new interface called `ITodoRepository`.
    - It should include methods for:
        - Saving a TodoItem
        - Getting a TodoItem by ID
        - Getting all items
        - Deleting an item by ID

```csharp
public interface ITodoRepository
{
    void Save(TodoItem item);
    TodoItem? GetById(Guid id);
    List<TodoItem> GetAll();
    void Delete(Guid id);
}
```

2. Create the In-Memory Implementation
    - In the `Persistence` folder create a class `InMemoryTodoRepository` that implements `ITodoRepository`.
    - Store items using a `dictionary`.
    - This will serve as your temporary, in-memory data store.


3. Register a Single Instance in `Program.cs`

- In Program.cs, create one instance of the `InMemoryTodoRepository`.
- Use this same instance across your handlers and menu methods.
- This way, your to-do items will stick around during the app’s lifetime.

4. Update the `CreateTodoItemCommandHandler`

- Change the constructor of the handler to accept an `ITodoRepository`.
- After creating the TodoItem, save it using the repository.


5. Add a “List All Items” Feature

- In your console project, create a method `ListItems()`.
- This method should:
    - Call the repository’s method to get all items.
    - Print them to the console in a readable format (ID, title, optional complete-by date).
- Register this method in your menu:

```csharp
  menu.AddItem("List all items", ListItems);
```

✅ Summary

You’ve now introduced:

- The concept of interfaces
- A simple persistence layer
- The ability to store and list to-do items

This is a key milestone — your app can now remember things!
