### Lesson 10

#### Saving To-Do Items to Disk

**Goal**:

In this lesson, you'll take your in-memory to-do list and make it persist between runs by saving items to a file. This means that
if the user closes and reopens the app, their to-do items will still be there.

✅ Tasks

1. Create a New Repository Implementation
    - In your console project, create a class named `OnDiskTodoRepository`.
    - This class should implement the `ITodoRepository` interface you created earlier.

2. Choose a Save Location
    - Store the file in a location that won’t be wiped during a rebuild.
    - Use the system's local app data folder (via `Environment.GetFolderPath`).
    - Create a TodoApp subfolder and store the file as todos.json.

3. Implement File-Based Storage
    - When the app starts, the repository should:
        - Check if the file exists.
        - If it does, read the content and load it into memory.
        - If it doesn’t, start with an empty list.
    - On every change (Save, Delete), write the updated list back to the file.

4. Use JSON for Serialization
    - Use `System.Text.Json` to serialize and deserialize the list of items.

5. Replace the In-Memory Repository
    - In `Program.cs`, replace your `InMemoryTodoRepository` with an instance of `OnDiskTodoRepository`.
    - Make sure it's reused across handlers and menu actions (same as before).

6. Test It
    - Create a few items using the menu.
    - Close and reopen the app.
    - Use the "List all items" option — your items should still be there.

✅ Summary

You’ve now:

- Persisted your to-do items across sessions
- Implemented your first file-based storage system
- Used JSON to serialize and deserialize application data
